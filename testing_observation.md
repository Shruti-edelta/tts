🔍 Observations

✅ Ground Truth:
Rich, detailed harmonics and structure across time.

Strong formant patterns and variations in energy.

❌ Prediction:
Over-smoothed output (loss of fine-grained details).

Blurry formants and lack of vertical structure (suggests poor frequency modeling).

Signal extends past ground truth length, likely due to misalignment or upsampling mismatch.

Possible collapse at end (visible vertical banding near 700+), which might indicate improper attention or decoding past valid input.
